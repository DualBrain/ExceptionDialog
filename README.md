# ExceptionDialog
A **reusable** Exception dialog for .NET applications!

## Projects

The two projects are very similar in structure; however, there are a few differences between the .NET Framework and .NET 5 (aka .NET Core).

### .NET 5 ('*net5*')

This project needs to be opened in Visual Studio 2019 v16.8+ or you can use the *dotnet* command line tool to build/run.  

### .NET Framework 4 ('*framework*')

I'm not sure how far back the project file will go for this project; however, I do know that the code will execute on .NET 4.0 and greater.
